<h2>INDY-1-RED-BookDatingApp</h2>
<h3><span class="resort">Overview:</h3>
<p>The Book Selector app is a mobile application designed to enhance the book discovery process by employing a user-friendly, swipe-based interface similar to dating apps like Hinge, Bumble, and Tinder. Current book recommendation systems focus solely on related books to the book on screen. An alternative book recommendation algorithm built on user preferences akin to dating app algorithms is crucial for the app’s core functionality: enhanced book discovery. The app is not supposed to replace Kindle or Goodreads; it is supposed to augment the book selection process by giving tailored results. Additionally, the app addresses the challenges of information overload by allowing users to quickly filter through potential reads based on their interests. Users can swipe left to dismiss a book or right to add it to their TBR (to-be-read) list. The app also enables deeper exploration by allowing users to scroll down for additional information, such as genre, key tropes, and quotes. Our objective is to develop a responsive and intuitive mobile application that combines with previous user dating app experience to provide an upgraded book discovery experience. User preferences guide the algorithm, providing both book recommendations to the user and a new way for authors and publishers to connect with their audiences.</p>
